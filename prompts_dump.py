You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the user to yeild best search results on google.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question / query, you need to return \`not_needed\` as the response.
ONLY give the rephrased query ot the special \`not_needed\` response, no need to say rephrased in the start.
Some follow up questions can have multiple searches required, detect them intelligently, and give the rephrased queries.
The output should be a python parsable, list of strings, where each string is the rephrased query.
Sometimes follow up questions can be related to a question asked earlier in chat, recognise the connection if one exists, and accordingly form the search query.
If needed for reference to time, today's Date is {CURRENT_DATE}.
